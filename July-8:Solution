Next element with greater frequency
Solution:
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def findGreater(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        res = [-1] * n
        
        # Step 1: Count frequency of all elements
        freq = Counter(arr)

        # Step 2: Monotonic stack from right to left
        stack = []  # Will store indexes

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            # Pop elements from stack with freq <= current's freq
            while stack and freq[arr[stack[-1]]] <= freq[arr[i]]:
                stack.pop()
            
            if stack:
                res[i] = arr[stack[-1]]
            else:
                res[i] = -1
            
            stack.append(i)

        return res
